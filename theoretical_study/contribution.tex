In this Part, we examine a series of theoretical quantum systems, 
    to assess the usefulness of the \gls{qmla} protocol described in \cref{part:algorithms}.

We begin in \cref{chapter:lattices} with ideal systems described by lattice models 
    under standard formalisms, i.e. Ising, Heisenberg and Hubbard models. 
This serves as a first test of the \gls{qmla} framework under reasonably straightforward
    conditions, where a small number of candidate models are proposed in advance, 
    with the true model gauranteed to be among them. 
The initial idea for this chapter was proposed by Dr. Rafaelle Santagati, 
    and refined together with Dr. Andreas Gentile and myself. 
I modified the \gls{qmla} software for this application, 
    ran the instances and analysed the data. 
The figures presented are my own.

In \cref{chapter:ga} we consider more general application of the \gls{qmla} protocol, 
    in significant model spaces comprising up to 250,000 valid candidate models. 
We explore these spaces efficiently by incorporating a \glsentryfull{ga} in \gls{qmla}. 
I proposed \glspl{ga} for the study of large model spaces, 
    and performed the initial hyperparameter tuning. 
I devised the numerous \glsentryfullpl{of} considered, 
    and in particular the combination of \glsentrylongpl{bf}
    with Elo ratings for a bespoke \gls{of} which takes advantage of \gls{qmla}'s core strengths. 
I built \gls{ga} infrastructure into the \gls{qmla} software, 
    ran the instances presented, and analysed the data.
The figures presented are my own.
