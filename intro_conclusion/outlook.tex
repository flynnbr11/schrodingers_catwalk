There is a large and growing interest in automatically identifying the models of quantum systems 
\cite{rigo2020machine, cranmer2020discovering, bairey2019learning, pickard2011ab, chertkov2018computational}.
Automated methodologies for identifying quantum mechanical models are becoming feasible with the development of 
quantum devices capable of simulating nature at the quantum level.
