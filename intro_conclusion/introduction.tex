Significant advances in the design and construction of quantum hardware in 
    recent years promise reliable, large scale quantum infrastructure
    in the near future \cite{arute2019quantum, zhong2020quantum}. 
Alongside improvements in quantum systems' control, progress in quantum algorithms and software 
    foreshadow impactful applications for quantum technologies, 
    from database search \cite{grover1997quantum} to quantum chemistry \cite{cao2019quantum} and drug design \cite{cao2018potential}.
Automated methodologies for characterising quantum systems are among the applications becoming feasible, 
    with the development of quantum devices capable of
    simulating nature at the quantum level \cite{childs2018toward}. 
There is a large and growing interest in automatically identifying the \emph{models} of quantum systems, 
    i.e. the mathematical structure representing the system's interactions
    \cite{rigo2020machine, cranmer2020discovering, bairey2019learning, pickard2011ab, chertkov2018computational}.

In parallel to the rise of quantum technologies over the past several decades,
    \glsentrylong{ml} and \glsentrylong{ai} have enjoyed increasing interest and resources.
Landmark outcomes, for example in facial recognition \cite{taigman2014deepface} 
    and complex strategy games \cite{silver2017mastering, brown2019superhuman},
    were bolstered by dramatic gains in the design of information processing devices
    such as supercomputing facilities and \glsentrylongpl{gpu} \cite{top500, lindholm2008nvidia}.

In this thesis we report progress in the domain of quantum system characterisation,
    through novel quantum algorithms empowered by the promise of quantum simulators, 
    leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. 
Namely, we introduce and develop the \gls{qmla} as a powerful platform for the study of 
    quantum systems ranging from controlled quantum simulators to experimental setups.
\gls{qmla} uncovers an approximate model for a given quantum system, 
    by constructing a series of candidate models and testing them against data from the system of interest.
In providing a robust software framework for \gls{qmla}, we initiate an exciting field of research 
    at the overlap of \gls{ml} and quantum simulation, 
    with proposed applications in calibrating new quantum technologies as well as understanding 
    quantum processes in nature.

\section{Main Results and Thesis Outline}

The works presented in this thesis are closely related, 
    all stemming from the \gls{qmla} algorithm and framework. 
The thesis is organised into \emph{parts}, 
    which group together related bodies of work. 
Within each part, individual studies are presented in self contained chapters;
    the main results and novel research is contained in \crefrange{part:algorithms}{part:experimental_study}.  
At the outset of each part, we summarise its chapters and contributions;
    the contents of each part are as follows. 

\begin{description}
    \item[\cref{part:contextual_review} Contextual Review] \
    
        We introduce the concepts upon which the thesis will build. 
        \cref{chapter:qm} establishes the vocabulary of \gls{qm}, 
            followed by a summary of \gls{ml} in \cref{chapter:ml}. 
        In both cases, we seek to introduce the minimal nomenclature required to 
            contextualise the work in the following chapters, 
            i.e. neither topic is described exhaustively. 
    
    \item[\cref{part:algorithms} Algorithms] \
    
        We provide a thorough explanation of the algorithms underlying this thesis. 
        We start by summarising \gls{qhl}, which serves as a key subroutine within later studies and should therefore 
            be understood in order to fully appreciate their contributions. 
        The first major result is the \gls{qmla} algorithm itself, 
            detailed in \cref{chapter:qmla}. 
        All subsequent chapters assume knowledge of the terminology and concepts related to \gls{qmla}, 
            so unfamiliar readers will find \cref{chapter:qmla} essential. 
        Our next contribution is an open source software platform for the implementation of \gls{qmla} 
            for the study of arbitary quantum systems.
        In \cref{chapter:sw} we list the implementation details of this framework, 
            but do not further any physical or algorithmic concepts. 
        The \gls{qmla} software is available at \cite{flynn2021QMLA} with documentation at \cite{qmla_docs}.
        By the end of \cref{part:algorithms}, 
            we are armed with \gls{qmla} as a tool for the inspection of target quantum systems of interest,
            which will serve as a platform for the remaining chapters.
        
    
    \item[\cref{part:theoretical_study} Theoretical Study] \
    
        We perform tests of the \gls{qmla} framework under idealised simulated conditions, 
            corresponding directly to \cite{flynn2021Quantum}. 
        We demonstrate that \gls{qmla} can is trustworthy in the most straightforward scenario, 
            where a number of candidate models are proposed in advance, in \cref{chapter:lattices}. 
        We then move to more difficult conditions in \cref{chapter:ga}, 
            exploring spaces of $10^5$ valid candidate models, by incorporating a \gls{ga} within \gls{qmla}. 
        Together, the cases studied here verify that \gls{qmla} shows promise in characterising quantum systems. 
    
    \item[\cref{part:experimental_study} Experimental Study] \

        The final contribution reflects work published \cite{gentile2020learning}.
        We extend the \gls{qmla} protocol to \emph{realistic} quantum systems, namely targeting the decoherence processes dominating the 
        dynamics of an electron spin in an \glsentrylong{nvc}. 
        In \cref{chapter:nv} we operate on data extracted from an experimental system, 
            from which \gls{qmla} distills models with high predictive power -- i.e. which can reproduce the dynamics of the target system -- 
            and which are in agreement with theoretical predictions. 
        \cref{chapter:nv} relied on several constraints to facilitate the model search; 
            in \cref{chapter:many_qubits} we relax some of those constraints by simulating a similar system, 
            and again exploiting a \gls{ga} to explore the model space. 
    
    \item[\cref{part:conclusion} Conclusion] \
    
        We close the thesis with a brief summary of its main contributions and the outlook for 
        model learning methodologies in the context of quantum technologies.
