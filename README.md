# Schrodingers Catwalk

This repository holds the LaTeX source code to my PhD thesis, `Schrodinger's Catwalk`. 
Files are organised according to the *Parts* of the thesis, with each chapter assigned a unique file. 

## Figure reproduction
All data presented in the thesis can be reproduced using the [QMLA framework](https::/github.com/flynnbr11/QMLA). 
Instructions for how to install/operate the codebase are available in the [QMLA documentation](https://quantum-model-learning-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The full configurations for each figure can be seen [on this table](https://github.com/flynnbr11/schrodingers_catwalk/blob/main/appendix/figures/figure_implementations.md).
