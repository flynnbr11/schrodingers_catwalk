\glsresetall
The default behaviour of the \gls{qmla} software framework is to generate 
    a \emph{results directory} for every \gls{run} of the algorithm, 
    uniquely identified by the date and time the \gls{run} was launched, 
    e.g. \ttt{qmla/launch/Jan\_01/12\_34}. 
Most of the figures presented in the main text analyse data from \glspl{run} of the \gls{qmla} framework;
    the results directory corresponding to each figure are listed (as \emph{Data}) in \cref{table:figure_reproduction},
    and all data presented herein can be downloaded from \cite{flynn2021schrodinger}. 
The presented figures are usually available as default analyses through the \gls{qmla} framework, 
    and therefore can be reproduced by implementing the corresponding configuration. 
In \cref{table:figure_reproduction} we list the core implementation details 
    -- $\Ne, \Np$ andthe \gls{es} -- used to achieve those results;
    complete configuration details and information are available at \cite{flynn2021schrodinger}.
Instructions for installing, configuring and running the \gls{qmla} software are given in \cref{apdx:software_eg}.

\section{Structure of results directory}
Within the \gls{results directory}, the outcome of the run's \glspl{instance} are stored, 
    with analysis plots broadly grouped as
\begin{easylist}
    \ListProperties(Start1=1)
    & \ttt{evaluation}: plots of probes and times used as the evaluation dataset. 
    & \ttt{instances}: outcomes of an individual \gls{qmla} \gls{instance}, 
        grouped by the \gls{instance} ID. 
        Includes results of training of individual models (in \ttt{model\_training}), 
        as well as sub-directories for anlaysis at the branch level (in \ttt{branches}) and \ttt{comparisons}. 
    & \ttt{combined\_datasets}: 
        \ttt{pandas} dataframes containing most of the data used during analysis of the \gls{run}. 
        Note that data on the individual model/instance level may be discarded so some minor analyses can not be 
        performed offline. 
    & \ttt{exploration\_strategy\_plots} plots specifically required by the \gls{es} at the \gls{run} level.
    & \ttt{champion\_models}: analysis of the models deemed champions by at least one \gls{instance} in the \gls{run}, 
        e.g. average parameter estimation for a model which wins multiple instances. 
    & \ttt{performance}: evaluation of the \gls{qmla} \gls{run}, 
        e.g. the  \gls{win rate}  of each model and the number of times each term is found in \glspl{champion model}. 
    & \ttt{meta} analysis of the algorithm' implementation, e.g. timing of jobs on each process in a cluster; 
        generally users need not be concerned with these. 
\end{easylist}
