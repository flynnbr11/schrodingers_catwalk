Most of the figures presented in the main text are generated directly by the \gls{qmla} framework. 
Here we list the implementation details of each figure so they may be reproduced
    by ensuring the configuration in \cref{table:figure_reproduction} are set in the launch script. 
The default behaviour of \gls{qmla} is to generate a results folder uniquely identified by the date and time 
    the \gls{run} was launched, e.g. results can be found at the \emph{\gls{results directory}} \ttt{qmla/Launch/Jan\_01/12\_34}. 
Given the large number of plots available, ranging from high-level \gls{run} perspective 
    down to the training of individual models, 
    we introduce a \ttt{plot\_level} $\in \{1, ..., 6\}$  for each \gls{run} of \gls{qmla}:
    higher \ttt{plot\_level} informs \gls{qmla} to generate more plots.  
\par  

Within the \gls{results directory}, the outcome of the run's \glspl{instance} are stored, 
    with analysis plots broadly grouped as
\begin{easylist}
    \ListProperties(Start1=1)
    & \ttt{evaluation}: plots of probes and times used as the evaluation dataset. 
    & \ttt{instances}: outcomes of an individual \gls{qmla} \gls{instance}, 
        grouped by the \gls{instance} ID. 
        Includes results of training of individual models (in \ttt{model\_training}), 
        as well as sub-directories for anlaysis at the branch level (in \ttt{branches}) and \ttt{comparisons}. 
    & \ttt{combined\_datasets}: 
        \ttt{pandas} dataframes containing most of the data used during analysis of the \gls{run}. 
        Note that data on the individual model/instance level may be discarded so some minor analyses can not be 
        performed offline. 
    & \ttt{exploration\_strategy\_plots} plots specifically required by the \gls{es} at the \gls{run} level.
    & \ttt{champion\_models}: analysis of the models deemed champions by at least one \gls{instance} in the \gls{run}, 
        e.g. average parameter estimation for a model which wins multiple instances. 
    & \ttt{performance}: evaluation of the \gls{qmla} \gls{run}, 
        e.g. the  \gls{win rate}  of each model and the number of times each term is found in \glspl{champion model}. 
    & \ttt{meta} analysis of the algorithm' implementation, e.g. timing of jobs on each process in a cluster; 
        generally users need not be concerned with these. 
\end{easylist}

In order to produce the results presented in this thesis, 
    the configurations listed in \cref{table:figure_reproduction} were input to the launch script.
The launch scripts in the \gls{qmla} codebase consist of many configuration settings for running \gls{qmla};
    only the lines in snippet in \cref{listing:launch_script} need to be set according to 
    altered to retrieve  the corresponding figures.
Note that the runtime of \gls{qmla} grows quite quickly with $\Ne, \Np$ (except for the \ttt{AnalyticalLikelihood} \gls{es}), 
    especially for the entire \gls{qmla} algorithm; running \gls{qhl} is feasible on a personal computer in 
    $<30$ minutes for $\Ne=1000; \Np=3000$.
