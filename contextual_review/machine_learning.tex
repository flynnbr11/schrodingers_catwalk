\section{Quantum \glsentrylong{ml}}
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
    & distinctions
    && q data q hardware $\rightarrow$ pure QML
    && q data classical hardware $\rightarrow$ ml for q physics
    && classical data q hardware $\rightarrow$ q enhanced ml
    && classical data c hardware $\rightarrow$ wrong thesis (\cref{sec:classical_ml})

    & examples/applications of QML 
    && QNN, q svm, 
    & Remit of this thesis $\rightarrow$ ml for q physics
    && i.e. using data from quantum system and/or hardware but in conjunction with classical co-processor, 
        for the study of quantum systems
